The Stopwatch is a web-based timer application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can start, stop, and reset the stopwatch to track elapsed time. The interface displays the elapsed time in hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds. JavaScript handles the logic for starting, stopping, and resetting the stopwatch, as well as updating the display with the current elapsed time. This tool is useful for tracking time intervals, timing activities, or managing tasks that require precise timing measurements.
